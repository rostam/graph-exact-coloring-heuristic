# Graph Exact Coloring Heuristic
## A Coloring Heuristic Based on Exact Coloring on Subgraphs

Welcome to the Graph Exact Coloring Heuristic project! This software computes a coloring heuristic based on exact coloring on subgraphs. 

The idea behind this project can be depicted using the following images:

![Initial Graph](coloring0.png)
*An initial graph which can be colored with an exact coloring algorithm or a heuristic*

![Built Graph](coloring1.png)
*A graph which is built from the initial graph*

![Heuristic Coloring](coloring2.png)
*A coloring with heuristics on the initial graph*

![Exact Coloring](coloring3.png)
*A coloring with exact coloring on the initial graph*

This project is in active development, and contributions are welcome. For more information, please refer to the source code and comments therein.
