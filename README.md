# graph-exact-coloring-heuristic
A software to compute a coloring heuristic based on exact coloring on subgraphs.
The idea can be depicted using the following images:

![](coloring0.png?raw=true)
*An initial graph which can be colored with an exact coloring algorithm or a heuritics*


![](coloring1.png?raw=true)
*A graph which build from the initial graph*


![](coloring2.png?raw=true) 
*A coloring with heuristics on the initial graph*


![](coloring3.png?raw=true)
*A coloring with exact coloring on the initial graph*
